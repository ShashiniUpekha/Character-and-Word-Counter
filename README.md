# Character-and-Word-Counter

## Introduction
One of the most important features of any written language is the occurrence of particular characters or words in general. For example, in the English language, all 26 characters are not used in
the same frequency. Generally, characters like e,a,t more frequently appear in text. These kinds of
information can be used in different applications such as Machine Learning, OCR, Cryptography,
etc. The same applies for words. Prepositions and articles like the, a, and, in are more frequently
used than other words. In project 2, you are supposed to observe this characteristic in the English
language using a program. A file or multiple files containing English text will be sent to the program, and the program should give an output (word or character frequencies) as a horizontal bar
chart printed on the terminal
